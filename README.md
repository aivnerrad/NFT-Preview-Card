## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

I used vanilla HTML and CSS to complete this challenge.

Users are able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
